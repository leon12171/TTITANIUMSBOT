A simple discord chat bot with a simple configuration. Written using [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).


# Large changes to the keyword/command configs

This most recent update will break your current keyword and command configs by moving the response one level deeper. This is to allow for reactions to be added on keywords. The bot can also mention a user for matched using the &user& string in the keyword response.

Reactions need to be copied in as a unicode emoji character.

### Old:
```
keyword:
  help:
    - "Please check the github page at <https://github.com/parkervcp/parkertron>"
    - "The default config is a good example of how to set commands up. Try `.help command`"
    - "My base chat parsing function is also available. Try `.help keyword` for more info"
```

### New:
```
keyword:
  help:
    reaction:
      - "ðŸ’ª"
    response:
      - "&user& Please check the github page at <https://github.com/parkervcp/parkertron>"
      - "The default config is a good example of how to set commands up. Try `.help command`"
      - "My base chat parsing function is also available. Try `.help keyword` for more info"
```


### Requirements:
tesseract-ocr w/ english trainign files (May support other languages but has not been tested.)
libleptonica (for tesseract)

So far I have the chat bot part down with no limiting or administration.

Configuration is done in yaml/json.  
If you have a Bot account already you can add the token and client ID's on your own.  
If you don't you will need to set your own account up.

The "owner" option in the configs is basically a super admin that will not be able to be blacklisted.

The prefix is the command prefix and is customizable.  
Set to "." by default it can be changed to whatever you want.


The Commands set up is simple and is also in json.  
See the commands.json for examples.
